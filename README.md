<h1>FriendFinder App (using the TV show, Firefly)</h2>

**Description**
<br>
This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application, using characters from the TV show, Firefly. I found the default questions from the example in GitLab to be a bit too generic for my liking, so I changed them up a bit. The survey in the app takes in user results, and then compares their submitted answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

**Development notes:**
<br>
This app works in node, but I'm troubleshooting the deployment in Heroku, and may have to modify the server.js file.
<br>
But, for now the app is usable through node. To use this app, download (git clone or download directly from git). Open Terminal into the FriendFinder directory. Then run "node server.js" in terminal. Finally, type "localhost:8080" into your browser to launch the app.
